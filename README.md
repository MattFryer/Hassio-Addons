# Home Assistant (Hassio) Add-Ons
This repository contains my personal add-ons for Home Assistant. Feel free to install and use the add-ons at your own risk if you think they will be useful. 

## Installation

Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Configuration** -> **Add-ons, Backups & Supervisor** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on Store** and add this URL as an additional repository:
```txt
https://github.com/MattFryer/Hassio-Addons
```
**NOTE**: For versions of Home Assistant prior to 2021.12 navigate to **Supervisor** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on Store** instead.
